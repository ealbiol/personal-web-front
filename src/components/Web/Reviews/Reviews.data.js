    "I have worked with Eduard as Managing Director at Alliantum SL. During the time we shared in that project Eduard was a professional of great value and his knowledge as a full-stack programmer was of great value to meet our objectives in a timely manner. In addition to the usual work, Eduard always contributed his opinion and solutions with a high degree of respect and intelligence. Eduard has been a pleasure to work with and his work has been recognised both internally and externally. I think it is also important to mention that Eduard integrated perfectly into the team and was highly valued by all his colleagues thanks to his personality.Without a doubt, if the opportunity arises, I will count on him again in my team and I would like to thank him publicly for his effort and the work he has done." ,

    comment: "Eduard is a highly motivated developer. He is really hungry to learn about new technologies, and increase his background with new tech stacks and programming languages. He started working with us as junior developer, in the time we were working together, he learned a lot about frontend development. He is able to handle the interaction between code and design, and gets along very well with responsive design and some CSS tweaks if needed. He is the kind of worker who wants to understand why and how something works. He always tries to see the logic behind source code, he never uses a copy-paste from Stack Overflow without understanding what a chunk of code does. He is good at concentrating on a task until it is finished. Finally, he has been living in several places and countries, he is open-minded and a very good teammate.",
